# The Legendre PRF

The Legendre pseudo-random function is a one-bit PRF $$\mathbb{F}_p \rightarrow \{0,1\}$$ defined using the [Legendre symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre_symbol):

$$ \displaystyle L_{p, K}(x) = \left\lceil\frac{1}{2}\left( \left(\frac{K + x}{p}\right) + 1\right)\right\rceil $$

## Suitability for MPC

Thanks to a result by Grassi et al. (2016), we know that this PRF can be evaluated very efficiently in arithmetic circuit multi-party computations (MPCs). Due to the multiplicative property of the Legendre symbol, a multiplication by a random square does not change the result of an evaluation. By additionally blinding with a random bit, the Legendre symbol can be evaluated using only three multiplications, two of which can be done offline (before the input is known).

To compute the Legendre symbol $$\left[\left(\frac{x}{p}\right)\right]$$ for an input $$[x]$$ (square brackets indicate a shared value):

1. Choose a quadratic non-residue $$\alpha$$

2. Pre-compute a random square $$[s^2]$$ and a random bit $$[b]$$

3. Open the value $$t \leftarrow \mathrm{Open}([x] [s^2]([b] + (1- [b]) \alpha) )$$

4. Compute $$u = \left(\frac{t}{p}\right)$$ on the open value $$t$$

5. The result of the computation is $$y = u (2 [b] -1 )$$

## Bounties

Because of its suitability for MPCs, the Legendre PRF is used in a construction for the Ethereum 2.0 protocol. In order to encourage research in this PRF, we announced some bounties at Crypto'19. See [bounties](bounties).
